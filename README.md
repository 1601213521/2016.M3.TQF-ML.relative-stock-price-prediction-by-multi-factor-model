# 2016.M3.TQF-ML.relative-stock-price-prediction-by-multi-factor-model

Project Description
This project would try to predict the stock return relative to market index by SVM method. Absolute stock price prediction is difficult and senseless, however relative stock return' prediction may be feasible and there are many relavant researches. After reading several analysis reports about multi-factor model, I chose 13 factors from the reports to do this analysis. 

Before implement the analysis, I have to check the efficiency of these factors I selecte. I compute the IC ratio and check the form of monotony. Then I
